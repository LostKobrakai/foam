# So good they can't ignore you

## Notes

4 Rules:

1. Don't follow your passion  
   Passion is the wrong entry to searching for fulfilling jobs.
   One needs Autonomy, Competence and Relatedness in a fulfilling job.
2. Be so good they can't ignore you
   Getting career capitial first is needed to trade for control.
3. Turn down a promotion
   You want to gain control. But don't do it to early (without career capital to trade)
   but also people will now actively try to not give you control (you're to important).
   Decide based on the "law of financial viability".
4. Thinks small, act big
   Missions require capital and little bets to be discovered. Marketing can help.
